							<h1>Outsourcing Game Development</h1>
							<p>It is not uncommon for companies that are professionally involved in game development to outsource their project development work to other companies. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that some companies have a limited number of qualified developers and the need to focus on other areas of the business. However, outsourcing development can entail certain risks. For example, if the company outsourcing the work is not sufficiently qualified, the game may be less than satisfactory. That is why it is worth trying to cooperate only with those companies and developers, whose experience and professionalism are beyond any doubt.</p>
